Others select to publish using DRM ( Digital Rights management) enabled photo galleries. These are more dissuasive than efficient. It will keep honest people honest but certainly not defeated a highly motivated thief. Our article on two of these DRM solutions expose their limitations.

Automatic Watermark Removal
  It's a tedious task to remove a watermark manually, which can can take even image editing experts several minutes. 
Even for a computer it is very difficult to automatically detect and remove a watermark on a single image. 
However, if watermarks are added in a consistent manner to many images, automatic removal becomes much easier.
  They found that simply changing the watermark position or random changes in its opacity do not improve security by much; 
however, slightly warping the watermark when embedding it in the image did the trick by producing a watermark that is very similar to the original but leaves very visible artifacts when removed by an algorithm. 
Estimating the random warp field that was applied to the watermark is simply too difficult for current algorithms.

WHAT DOES IMATAG DO ABOUT THIS ATTACK ?
Imatag has nothing to do. 
The security level of our invisible watermarking is much higher than that of visible watermarks. 
Our technique does not suffer from the weaknesses above-mentioned:

Our invisible watermark spreads all over the image to achieve excellent robustness.
It has the same statistical distribution than the visual content of the image to prevent any filtering.
Each photo is protected by its own watermark. 
There is no repetition. 
Even if an attacker succeeds to estimate the invisible watermark signal of one photo, this information is useless for attacking other pictures.
In brief, the Google attack does not work at all on images tagged by Imatag.

Digital watermarking is obviously useful for content identification by embedding identifiers into images. A clear advantage over CBR is that several versions of the same original image can be created if need be. This allows to distinguish versions of one image belonging to several photo agencies, for instance. Another application embeds the identifier of the client who buys images. This allows to trace back dishonest clients, i.e. people illegally redistributing legally paid content.  This is called forensics watermarking.
